# Blush ðŸ› 

Blush is a small function with a set of helpers to make creating styles in react native more productive and easy

# âœ… Working Features!

  - Get access to device width and height and a normalize function
  - Set styles for every platform
  ```sh
const style = Blush(({deviceWidth,deviceHeight,normalize})=>({
      container: {
        margin: deviceWidth,
        ios: {
          padding: deviceHeight
        },
        android: {
            fontSize: normalize(16)
        }
      }
}))
```
  - You can use Blush without passing a function if you don't need the helpers
  ```sh
const style = Blush({
      container: {
        margin: 10,
        ios: {
          padding: 10
        },
        android: {
            fontSize: 16
        },
        rtl:{
            backgroundColor: "#fff"
        }
      }
})
```
